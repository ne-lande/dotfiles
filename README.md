# nelande's dotfiles

## What it is

My personal dotfiles repo!
I'm trying to revisit it every 2 weeks with fixes and improvments

These configs must be crossplatform within **ARCH** ~~btw~~ and OSX

## What is done (nothing is done)

 - Nvim config
 - Kitty config
 - Zsh config

## What needs to be done

 - Setup script
 - ~~neofetch config~~
 - Putting dotfiles on framework rails (maybe?)
 - Unified keymaps (almost, ~~kde fucks me in the ass :c~~)
 - Starship config
